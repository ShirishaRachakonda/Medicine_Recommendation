        <p>Welcome to the <strong>Personalized Medical Recommendation System</strong> — an academic project developed as part of our final year engineering curriculum. This platform represents the integration of healthcare knowledge with technological innovation to create an accessible health advisory solution.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Our Vision</h4>
        <p>We envision a future where healthcare support and information are accessible to all. This project was initiated with the idea of empowering individuals to take proactive steps in managing their health through symptom-based analysis and personalized recommendations.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Who We Are</h4>
        <p>We are final year engineering students driven by a passion for solving real-world problems using technology. With a shared interest in data science, healthcare, and web development, we collaborated to build this system under academic guidance as part of our capstone project.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Our Mission</h4>
        <p>Our mission is to deliver a user-friendly platform that helps individuals predict possible health conditions based on their symptoms and receive relevant suggestions. The system also offers additional resources such as medication guidance, dietary advice, and lifestyle tips.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">How It Works</h4>
        <p>This system leverages a machine learning model trained on a dataset of diseases and symptoms. When a user inputs their symptoms, the model predicts the most probable illness and provides customized recommendations to assist with further action or lifestyle improvement.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Our Commitment</h4>
        <p>We understand that interpreting health information can be overwhelming. That's why our platform aims to simplify this process by offering clear predictions along with helpful resources such as disease information, preventive measures, and dietary guidance—all in one place.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Join Us on This Journey</h4>
        <p>We invite you to explore and interact with our system. As engineering students, we are proud to contribute to the intersection of healthcare and technology through this project. Your experience and feedback help us learn and grow.</p>

        <p class="mt-3"><strong>Thank you</strong> for exploring our project. We hope it proves informative and helpful as a step toward smarter, tech-enabled healthcare.</p>
